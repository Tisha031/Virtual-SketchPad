# Virtual-SketchPad
This project is a virtual sketchpad that uses hand tracking via webcam to let users draw, select colors, and create shapes on a digital canvas without touching the screen. It features gesture-based controls for drawing, clearing, and shape selection, making it an interactive and touchless whiteboard experience
